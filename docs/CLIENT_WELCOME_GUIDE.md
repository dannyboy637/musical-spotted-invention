Click on any item to see details and trends.

## Tips for Best Results

The executive dashboard takes just 30 seconds to review. Make it part of your morning routine.

### 2. Act on Stars & Dogs
Focus on promoting Stars and evaluating Dogs regularly. Small menu changes can have big revenue impacts.

### 3. Use Date Comparison
When reviewing a period, compare it to the same period last year or last month to understand seasonality.

### 4. Review Alerts Promptly
Alerts catch problems early. The sooner you investigate, the faster you can respond.

### 5. Share with Your Team
Use the shareable links (filters are saved in the URL) to send specific views to your managers.
